                    <p id="tab-pf-desc"> While working on my resume website, I gained valuable insights into the complexities of web development. I discovered the necessity of considering mobile design for a seamless user experience across all devices. Embracing safe programming principles was crucial in maintaining the integrity and security of my project. Finally, I improved my skills in version control by efficiently pulling and pushing changes using GitHub.</p>

                    <p id="tab-pf-desc"> Throughout my time in College I picked up many skills for programming. One of the skills I am most proud of is my ability to write full programs in command-line editors and text editors. I used Sublime Text for multiple years, which benefited me as I learned how to look for errors in my code for debugging, rather than something like VS Code explicitly telling me what is going wrong. Because of this, I feel I am fit to program and debug programs in any environment. I also used vim for an entire semester as a code editor. This helped me become familiar with the command line, and gave me the opportunity to experience programming without an elaborate GUI. Naturally, I do still have plenty of experience with creating and using environments in Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code. I have also used Eclipse for many personal projects. GitHub and Git are both important tools as now I use them for almost every project I am involved with. Lastly, I have academic experience with Kubernetes and Docker. </p>
                    <h2>Programming Languages</h2>
                    <p id="tab-pf-desc">During my four years at Augustana University, I gained proficiency in several programming languages. I began with Python, which I have consistently utilized for over four years. Additionally, I completed coursework in C++ and C, both of which I have applied over the same period. My most extensive experience is with Java, which I used extensively in numerous projects. Furthermore, I completed multiple web design courses, acquiring skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and working with Express and Node.js for class assignments. Additionally, I undertook a course in database processing, where I learned to work with MySQL.</p>

            <p id = "trc-text">My name is Matthew Isbell and I am a recent Computer Science & Software Engineering major at Augustana University in Sioux Falls, SD. I decided to do CS and German simply because they are both passions of mine. German first interested me because of my family background but studying it in high school solidified my passion. This led me to studying in Berlin and perusing language throughout college. The idea of studying computer science has been a dream of mine ever since I was little. I have always been interested in how computer programs work, how games are made, and how websites are put together. Because of this, I knew I wanted to learn as much as I could about the world of Computer Science in college.</p>
            <p id = "trc-text">Outside of my studies at Augustana, I have multiple hobbies I enjoy doing in my free time. I really enjoy working out and running, as I want to be as healthy and fit as I can. I also enjoy cooking and baking meals. Even though I try to be as healthy as I can, that doesn’t stop me from cooking unhealthy things! I think my favorite stuff to make is desserts, but you really can’t go wrong with anything.</p>
            <p id = "trc-text">One of my hobbies I spend a lot of time with is playing and modifying games. I really enjoy playing games to unwind after a long day. My favorite games to play are Minecraft, the Dark Souls franchise, and various city builder games. When I want to really dive into something new, I love taking apart games and learning how to make mods for them. I have created a few Minecraft and Dark Souls mods for fun but haven’t published many. I also enjoy working on various programming side projects. I have ideas for many games and apps and am slowly making progress on all of them. I hope to one day have a published app or program that people can enjoy.</p>
